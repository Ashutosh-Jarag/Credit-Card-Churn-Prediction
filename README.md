# Credit Card Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a deep learning model to predict credit card customer churn using a dataset from Kaggle. My work involved loading the dataset, performing data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare it for modeling, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior. I then designed and trained a deep neural network to classify customers as likely to churn or not, optimizing for accuracy and evaluating the model’s performance.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.8+**: Core language for data processing and model building
- **Pandas**: For loading, cleaning, and manipulating the Kaggle dataset
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations during preprocessing
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data distributions and churn patterns
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For constructing and training the deep learning model
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding) and evaluation metrics
  - **kaggle Notebook**: Where I documented the entire workflow

## Key Features
- Cleaned and preprocessed the Kaggle dataset to handle missing values and categorical features
- Conducted EDA to explore factors influencing churn (e.g., transaction history, demographics)
- Built a deep neural network with multiple layers to predict churn
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
- Visualized results to highlight key insights about churn predictions

## How to Set It Up
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Jarag/Credit-Card-Churn-Prediction.git`
2. Install required packages.
3. Download the dataset from Kaggle: "https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashutoshjarag/credit-card-customer-churn-prediction/input"
4. Place the dataset (e.g., `Churn_Modelling.csv`) in the project folder
5. Open `credit-card-customer-churn-prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the code

## How to Use It
